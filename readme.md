# JonasTrap Framework

## Quote
I added this because it is usefull to see clearly where a quote is written. 

## Card Deck
The custom card deck has some shade on the box and a thicker line. 
It is visualy improved. 

## Heading1
Heading 1 is customized to have a better look and iÂ´ve added some letter spacing as well. 

## Heading6

Heading 6 is good for sub-titles, the customization makes it a pleasure to read. 

## Navbar 

With the background color and the link styling gone it is clear that is is a navbar. 
The bar is connected to all the different custom styles on my html page.
